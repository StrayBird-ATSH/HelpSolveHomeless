\hypertarget{data-collection}{%
\subsection{Data Collection}\label{data-collection}}

We used the statistical data retrieved from U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics\footnote{U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2019, September).
  BLS Data Finder 1.1. Retrieved from \url{https://www.bls.gov/data/}.},
Zillow Group\footnote{Zillow Group. (2019, September). Houses For Rent
  in Los Angeles CA - 2,651 Homes \textbar{} Zillow. Retrieved from
  \url{https://www.zillow.com/los-angeles-ca/rent-houses/}.} and
California Department of Public Health\footnote{California Department of
  Public Health. (2019, September). CDPH Home. Retrieved from
  \url{https://www.cdph.ca.gov/}.} to provide a general impression of
trend and status quo of the homeless people and sheltered homeless
people in Los Angeles. The figure showing this perspective is on the
slides page 2 and 3.

\hypertarget{analysis-of-the-situation-of-the-homeless-population}{%
\subsection{Analysis of the situation of the homeless
population}\label{analysis-of-the-situation-of-the-homeless-population}}

From the figure, we can have a strong impression that in Los Angeles,
there are as many as Â¾ of the homeless people that are not sheltered
yet. Furthermore, the overall homeless population is increasing
significantly in recent years. However, what disappoints us is that the
shelterings the government can provide for the homeless people is
generally not increasing. They remain the same in the decade and
therefore making the contradiction of shelter need and the providing of
shelter even more severe.

homelessness}\label{analysis-of-the-factors-causing-homelessness}}

\hypertarget{factors-considered-and-data-source}{%
\subsection{Factors considered and data
source}\label{factors-considered-and-data-source}}

After having a knowledge of the general fact of homeless people in Los
Angeles, we have dug much deeper into the reasons that lead to the
severity of homelessness. We have searched and collected data from U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics\footnote{U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
  (2019, September). BLS Data Finder 1.1. Retrieved from
  \url{https://www.bls.gov/data/}.} including the Consumption Price
Index(CPI), Minimum Wages, Unemployment rate, House rental price and
drug addict population in the city of Los Angeles.

\hypertarget{principal-component-analysis}{%
\subsection{Principal Component
Analysis}\label{principal-component-analysis}}

We want to examine whether and how these factors affect the results.
Here we implement the Principal Component Analysis method to process the
data. The factors we consider include CPI, minimum wages, unemployment
rate, house rental price and drug addictive population.

\hypertarget{processing-steps-for-principal-component-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Processing steps for Principal Component
Analysis}\label{processing-steps-for-principal-component-analysis}}

For the first step, because the data value differ greatly in terms of
units and absolute value, we used Standardization into a range from 0 to
1 so that the different values will be able to compare with each other.
After standardization, we imported the data into R and utilized the
princomp function to perform the principal component analysis. From the
result, we can see that the first component has a Proportion of Variance
at 93\%, while the first two components have a Proportion of Variance of
97\%. This means the factors are in a highly uniform trend and can be
reduced to only one or two dimensions. After our looking more thoroughly
into the principal component analysis result, we will find out from the
loadings of the factors to the components, the five factors we are
observing are having almost equal relation with the dependent variable -
the overall homeless population. Therefore, we can conclude that these
factors possess a strong effect on the overall homeless people.

\hypertarget{reasoning-for-the-result-from-principal-component-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Reasoning for the result from Principal Component
Analysis}\label{reasoning-for-the-result-from-principal-component-analysis}}

The increasing price index and house rental prices make living expenses
even higher for people with lower income and the rising unemployment
rate may make more people homeless. What's more, drug addiction, as a
common but severe social phenomenon, is also becoming more severe in Los
Angeles and we cannot deny the possibility that there are many people
who fall into homelessness due to drug addiction.

\hypertarget{advice-proposed-to-the-government}{%
\section{Advice proposed to the
government}\label{advice-proposed-to-the-government}}

In conclusion, we are calling for the government to take various
measures to curb this phenomenon both from the source and from the
result. They can enhance the infrastructure construction to provide more
shelter for the homeless people to relieve this problem soon. They can
also take measures like providing drug rehabilitation programs,
providing more temporary working opportunities for the unemployed
people, controlling house rental price or providing more alternative
housing for low income population and so on.
